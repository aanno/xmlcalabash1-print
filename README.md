# XML Calabash support for printing with XSL FO and CSS

This repository contains
[XML Calabash 1.0](http://github.com/ndw/xmlcalabash1) support for
printing with
[XSL FO](http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/xsl#w3c_all) or
[CSS](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/).

Support is included for XSL FO processing with
[FOP](https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/),
[AntennaHouse](http://www.antennahouse.com/antenna1/xsl-specification/),
or
[RenderX](http://www.renderx.com/)
and CSS processing with
[AntennaHouse](http://www.antennahouse.com/antenna1/css/)
or
[PrinceXML](http://www.princexml.com/).

Printing with XML Calabash requires these libraries in addition to any
commercial libraries required. (No additional libraries are required
for FOP.)

This step should work with either Saxon 9.5 or Saxon 9.6.
